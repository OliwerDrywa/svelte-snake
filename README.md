# What is this?

This is a (for now) simple game of snake created in Svelte, for the purpose of learning Svelte, offline-first design through service-workers, and other web technologies; and other dev tools such as firebase, CI, and Github itself.
Possible future features include: auth, some 3D, local and online multiplayer...
